This repository contains an example Java project showing how to use Applitools Native Mobile Grid with Appium for Android apps.
It is my first Appium test automation project!


## Influences

I learned how to start testing with Appium from
[Gaurav Singh](https://twitter.com/automationhacks)'s guides and example code below:

* [Hello Appium, Part 1: What is Appium? An Introduction to Appium and its Tooling](https://applitools.com/blog/what-is-appium-introduction-to-appium/)
* [Hello Appium, Part 2: Writing Your First Android Test](https://applitools.com/blog/how-to-write-android-test-appium/)
* [Appium Fast Boilerplate GitHub repository](https://github.com/automationhacks/appium-fast-boilerplate)


## Workbench Setup

Setting up an Appium project is no small task.
You'll need to install and configure the following:

* A Java IDE like [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) or [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/)
* [Java Development Kit](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/) (JDK)
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
* [Appium](https://appium.io/) 1.2x.x
* [Appium Doctor](https://github.com/appium/appium-doctor)
* [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio)
* An [Android emulator](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/emulator)
* [Appium Inspector](https://github.com/appium/appium-inspector)

Follow Gaurav's guides listed above for instructions on setting up everything.
